# TFC - Trybe Football Club

The project's goal was to create a restful API that connects to a mySQL database via Sequelize in order to read, create, filter, update, the data and so on. The following routes were created: login, matches, teams, and leaderboard.

## Technologies used:

> ⚠️ Front: React.js and RTL. (Because the front-end was done by Trybe staff, I did not write any of the code in the application's front-end. Therefore, will not be included in this repository

> Back: TypeScript, Node.js, Docker, Express, MySQL, Sequelize, JWT, bcrypt, and Mocha / Chai serve as the backend. TDD was used as an API development tool. Since I created the backend, you can find everything in the SRC folder.

# Final Result:

> We begin by logging in: The validation is made by using jwt and bcrypt to encript the password when sending to the database.
> Then, we are able to search for matches, teams, and the ranking. As an admin, we are also allowed to update and create data.
